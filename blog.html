						<h3 class="page-title">How To Build iOS UIs Programmatically</h3>
						<div class="line-break1"></div>
						<p>New to iOS? A seasoned native developer? Either way, many of you will have come across certain issues when it comes to using storyboard.</p>
						<p>- Transitions: For starters, segues can sometimes prove to be too messy to handle as the number of screens grow in your application.</p>
						<p>- Code Refactor: Whenever we change the variable names of markers — IBOutlets and IBActions — be it for optimization or readability, we often have to reconnect the variables that have been refactored, else the app crashes.</p>
						<p>- Constraints: Ever have many UI properties stacked upon one another, nested subviews, in a single screen? Having to individually set these constraints can be confusing at times when the warning signs pop up. Or worse, when you accidentally clicked on Clear Constraints for All Views in View Controller.</p>
						<p>That being said, using a storyboard still has its pros — ability to visualize and very easy to pick up — and creating UIs programmatically can pose a steep learning curve. Essentially, storyboard is good for visualizing the design flow and allowing for quick mock ups for the application. However, your code can be more robust and reliable by programmatically creating the entire application from scratch. While this approach may take more time to learn and set up, you can definitely speed things up once you get the hang of it. Therefore, should time and resources allow, I definitely recommend new and seasoned iOS developers to give the programmatic way a go.</p>
